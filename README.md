# My notes
![logo_Banner.png](Hero_Image_notes.png)

These are my notes. Here I write, collect, and sometimes copy information about:  

* Concepts or tools I'm learning to improve on y Daily Job.    
* A new Hobby.    
* Something interesting.    

I store all my notes in different categories. The main idea is to have easy access to knowledge and use those notes as a quick personal reference.

**NOTE:** I use different sources, therefore I must clarify, not all the content is mine. I will try to change, summarize, or put my explanations but in some cases, I keep the original sentence or the graphic since I believe provide excellent information and doesn't worth it to change it.

> *PS:* My mother tongue is Spanish, but I like to read and write in English, so if someone, other than me, reads these notes, please be patient, they are personal notes, not a blog.

> You might find that some topics are not finished, some spelling errors, or odd sentences, I'm working on that ;).
