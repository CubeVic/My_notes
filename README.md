2. Machine learning
3. Python as a tool for financial analysis or automation of "boring" tasks.


## Daily Job

1. Concepts about CCTV equipment.
2. Basic, and I emphasize, Basic knowledge about networks.

## Other Interest

**NOTE:** I use different sources. I must clarify, not all the content is mine. I will try to change, summarize,  clarify or put my take on the topic, but in some cases, I keep the original sentence or the graphic since I believe it will provide excellent information, and doesn't worth it to change it.

> You might find that some topics are incomplete, with some spelling errors or odd sentences. I'm working on that ;).
