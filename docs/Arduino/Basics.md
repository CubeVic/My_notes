The arduino code has two basic "Functions", these functions are a requirement to the script to run, other functions can be define and use inside this basic loops, these basic function are:

* `Setup` function.
* `Loop` function.

## `setup` function

In this function we are going to put code that will be run just one time, this is use to set up ports, define variables, etc.


```C
void setup(){
  
}
```


## `loop` function

## Global variable
