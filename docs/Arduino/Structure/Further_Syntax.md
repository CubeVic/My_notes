##define

###Description
`#define` is a useful C++ component that allows the programmer to give a name to a constant value before the program is compiled. Defined constants in arduino donâ€™t take up any program memory space on the chip. The compiler will replace references to these constants with the defined value at compile time.

**Unwanted side effects:** 
A constant name that had been `#defined` is included in some other constant or variable name. In that case the text would be replaced by the `#defined` number (or text).

The `const` keyword is preferred for defining constants and should be used instead of `#define`.

**Syntax**

```C++
#define constantName value
```

**Parameters:**

* *constantName:* the name of the macro to define.
* *value:* the value to assign to the macro.

####Example Code
```C++
#define ledPin 3
```
