#`#define`

###Description
`#define` is a useful C++ component that allows the programmer to give a name to a constant value before the program is compiled. Defined constants in arduino donâ€™t take up any program memory space on the chip. The compiler will replace references to these constants with the defined value at compile time.

**Unwanted side effects:**
A constant name that had been `#defined` is included in some other constant or variable name. In that case the text would be replaced by the `#defined` number (or text).

The `const` keyword is preferred for defining constants and should be used instead of `#define`.

**Syntax**

```C++
#define constantName value
```

**Parameters:**

* *constantName:* the name of the macro to define.
* *value:* the value to assign to the macro.

####Example Code
```C++
#define ledPin 3
```

## `#include (include)`

**Syntax**

**Examples**

## `&` reference operator

This operator is use with pointers, if `x` is a variable, `&x` represent the address of the variable.

**Syntax**

```C++
int *p;       // declare a pointer to an int data type
int i = 5;
int result = 0;
p = &i;       // now 'p' contains the address of 'i'
result = *p;  // 'result' gets the value at the address pointed by 'p'
              // i.e., it gets the value of 'i' which is 5
```

## `*` Dereference operator

The Arduino Documentation call it "Dereference", the `*` is use to represent the Dereference.
"[...] If `p` is a pointer, then `*p` represents the value contained in the address pointed by `p`."

**Syntax**
```C++
int *p;       // declare a pointer to an int data type
int i = 5;
int result = 0;
p = &i;       // now 'p' contains the address of 'i'
result = *p;  // 'result' gets the value at the address pointed by 'p'
              // i.e., it gets the value of 'i' which is 5
```
