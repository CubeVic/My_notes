Lets start with some basic concept that are present in bold in the course 

* **Machine language**: LAnguage use for the computers, very rudimentary.
* **Natural Language**: Language use by people, it is constantly evolving, new words are created every day and old one disappear. 
* **Instruction list** (IL): a complete set of know commands 

## What is a language

> I paraphrase the original information of the course since it is condense and simple

* **An Alphabet:** A set of symbols use to build a word.
* **A Lexis:**  also known as dictionary, it is a set of words available in to be use.
* **A Syntax:** A set of rules used to determine if a certain string of words make a valid sentence 
* **Semantics:** a set of rules to determining if a certain phrase make sense.

The IL o Instruction list is the alphabet for the machine, this is the simplest set of symbols that can be use to give commands to the computer.
In order to give instruction to the computer we need a intermediary language, complex enough to be human readable, simple enough so computer can follow, this languages are called **High-Level programming Language**, a program written with this language is call **source code** and a file  containing this code will be a **source file**.
