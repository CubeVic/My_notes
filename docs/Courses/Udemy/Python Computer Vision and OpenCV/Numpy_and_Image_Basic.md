>This session will cover numpy, this is specially useful since the images are going to be represented as numpy arrays most of the time, here the [numpy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html)

## The Basics

NumPyâ€™s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers. In NumPy dimensions are called axes.

For example, the coordinates of a point in 3D space `[1, 2, 1] `has one axis. That axis has 3 elements in it, so we say it has a length of 3. In the example pictured below, the array has 2 axes. The first axis has a length of 2, the second axis has a length of 3.

```python
[[1,0,0],
[0,1,2]]
```
