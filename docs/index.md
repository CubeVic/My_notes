# Victor Andres Aguirre Fernandez

These are my notes 
* What I'm learning to improve my Daily Job. 
* A new Hobby.
* Or something I found interesting.

I store all notes in different categories, which are constantly changing, the idea is to have easy access to knowledge and use as a quick personal reference.


1. [Machine learning](https://cubevic.github.io/My_notes/Machine%20Learning/Google%20Crash%20Course/Problem_Framing.html)
2. [Coding](https://cubevic.github.io/My_notes/Coding/Python/Preparation%20for%20PCPP-32-1/Module%201.html)
3. [Courses](https://cubevic.github.io/My_notes/Courses/Coursera/AI%20for%20Everyone/AI_for_Everyone.html)
4. [3D printing](https://cubevic.github.io/My_notes/3D%20Printing/Concepts.html) 
5. [Miscellaneous](https://cubevic.github.io/My_notes/Miscellaneous/Aliases_in_Windows_command_prompt.html)


**NOTE:** I use different resources and not all the content is mine, there are different authors and the credits/attributions are for them, in some cases, I use the same graphic the original Author use ( but i try not to), just because they give a clear picture or useful information.

*PS:* My native language is not English, so if someone other than me sees these notes, please be patient, these are personal notes, not a blog, thus, some topics are not finished and I might have some spelling errors or some weird sentences.


I'm using MkDocs to generate this *"notes"* more information visit [mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).
