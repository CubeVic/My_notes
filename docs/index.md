# Victor Andres Aguirre Fernandez 

These are my notes here I write, collect, and sometimes copy information about:  

* Concepts or Tools that I'm learning to improve on my Daily Job.    
* A New Hobby.    
* Something Interesting.    

I store all my notes in different categories with the idea is to have easy access to knowledge and as a quick personal reference.

<aside>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> I use different sources to learn or to consult.  I must clarify, not all the content is mine. I will change, summarize, or put my explanations for some topics. However,  I keep the original sentence or the graphic if I believe it provides information and doesn't worth it to change it.

> *PS:* These are personal notes, so if someone other than me reads them bear in mind it is a work in progress, I will update, fix errors or re-write it.

I'm using MkDocs to generate these *"notes"* more information visit [mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).
