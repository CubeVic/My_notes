These are my notes, what I'm learning to improve my Daily Job, a new Hobby or just something that I found interesting.

I store all notes about the different categories, which are constantly changing, the idea is to have easy access to knowledge and use as a quick personal reference.

**NOTE:** I use different resources and not all the content is mine, there are different authors and the credits/attributions are for them, in any moment I want to say the content is totally created by me, in some cases I use the same graphic the original Author use, just because they give a clear picture or useful information.

*PS:* My native language is not English, so if someone other than me sees this notes, please be patient, this is personal notes, not a blog, thus, some topics are not finished yet (because I'm learning it).


I'm using MkDocs to generate this *"documentation"* more information visit [mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).
