These are my Notes, what I'm learning to improve my Daily Job, a new Hobby or just something that i found interesting.

I store all notes about the different categories, which are constantly changing, the idea is to have easy access to knowledge and use a s a quick personal reference.

**NOTE:** I use different resources and not all the content is mind, there are different authors and the credits/attribution are for them, in any moment i want to say the content is totally created by me, in some cases i use the same graphic the original Author use, just because they give a clear picture or useful information.

*PS:* My native language is not English, so there might be sentence that are to wordy, or odd ...., I'm working on it.

Initially will be locally and in my github.

I'm using MkDocs to generate this *"documentation"* more information visit [mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).
