# Welcome My notes

This is where I store all notes about the different topics im learning, the idea is to have easy access to the notes from anywhere, initially will be locally and in github eventually to a personal server
I'm using MkDocs to generate this "documentation" more information visit [mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).
