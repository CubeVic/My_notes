# Victor Andres Aguirre Fernandez

These are my notes, here, I write, collect, and sometimes copy information about:  

* Concepts or tools  I'm learning to improve on y Daily Job.    
* A new Hobby.    
* Something interesting.    

I store all my notes in different categories. The main idea is to have easy access to knowledge and use those notes as a quick personal reference.


1. [Machine learning](https://cubevic.github.io/My_notes/Machine%20Learning/Google%20Crash%20Course/Problem_Framing.html)
2. [Coding](https://cubevic.github.io/My_notes/Coding/Python/Preparation%20for%20PCPP-32-1/Module%201.html)
3. [Courses](https://cubevic.github.io/My_notes/Courses/Coursera/AI%20for%20Everyone/AI_for_Everyone.html)
4. [3D printing](https://cubevic.github.io/My_notes/3D%20Printing/Concepts.html) 
5. [Miscellaneous](https://cubevic.github.io/My_notes/Miscellaneous/Aliases_in_Windows_command_prompt.html)


**NOTE:** I use different sources, therefore I must clarify, not all the content is mine. I will try to change, summarize, or put my explanations but in some cases, I keep the original sentence or the graphic since I believe provide excellent information and doesn't worth it to change it.

> *PS:* My mother tongue is Spanish, but I like to read and write in English, so if someone, other than me, reads these notes, please be patient, they are personal notes, not a blog.

> You might find that some topics are not finished, some spelling errors, or odd sentences, I'm working on that ;).


I'm using MkDocs to generate this *"notes"* more information visit [mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).
