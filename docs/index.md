# My Notes

This is where I store all notes about the different topics im learning, the idea is to have easy access to the notes from anywhere, initially will be locally and in github eventually to a personal server
I'm using MkDocs to generate this "documentation" more information visit [mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).


## Useful MkDocs Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs help` - Print this help message.
