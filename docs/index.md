# Victor Andres Aguirre Fernandez 

These are my notes here I write, collect, and sometimes copy information about:  

* Concepts or tools  I'm learning to improve on y Daily Job.    
* A new Hobby.    
* Something interesting.    

I store all my notes in different categories with the idea is to have easy access to knowledge and as a quick personal reference.


**NOTE:** I use different sources to learn or to consult.  I must clarify, not all the content is mine. I will change, summarize, or put my explanations for some topics. However,  I keep the original sentence or the graphic if I believe it provides information and doesn't worth it to change it.

> *PS:* These are personal notes, so if someone other than me reads them, you might find typos or weird formatted sentences.

I'm using MkDocs to generate these *"notes"* more information visit [mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).
