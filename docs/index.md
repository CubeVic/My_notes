These are my notes, here, I write, collect, and sometimes copy information about:  

* Concepts or tools  I'm learning to improve on y Daily Job.    
* A new Hobby.    
* Something interesting.    

I store all my notes in different categories (I called them notebooks). The main idea is to have easy access to knowledge and use those notes as a quick personal reference.


**NOTE:** I use different sources, therefore I must clarify, not all the content is mine. I will try to change, summarize, or put my explanations but in some cases, I keep the original sentence or the graphic since I believe provide excellent information and doesn't worth it to change it.

> *PS:* These meant to be personal notes, so if someone, other than me, reads these notes, please be patient, you might get across typos or weird formatted sentences.

I'm using MkDocs to generate this *"notes"* more information visit [mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).
