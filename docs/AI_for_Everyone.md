##Starting an AI projects  
* Workflow of a project.  
* Select AI project (Framework).  
* Organizing data and teams for the project.  

## Workflow of a Machine Learning project  

1. Collect data.  
1. Train the model. (_Iterate many times until achieve the result._)
1. Deploy model. (_Get back maintain and update._)

## Workflow of a Data Science project.
Unlike a machine learning project, the output of a data science project is often a set of actionable insights, a set of insights that may cause you to do things differently.  

1. Collect Data.  
1. Analyze Data. (_Iterate many times to get good insights_)
1. Suggest Hypotheses/actions (_Deploy changes, re-analyze new data_)

## Build a AI company

**Case Study: Smart speaker**
To get a better idea about what is need it to build a AI company it is important to get and idea of what is need it in an AI system. 

_Steps to process a command_  
1. Trigger word/wakeword detection ("Hello Device").  
2. Speech recognition.  
3. Intent recognition.  
4. Execute joke.

**Case study: Self-driving car**

the key steps:  
1. Car detection.  
2. Pedestrian detection.  
3. Motion Planning.

**Example roles of a AI team**

This roles might have other titles but the task that they perform will be similar:

* Software Engineer:  those who develop the business logic, like the joke execution or those to ensure self-driving reliability.  
* Machine Learning Engineer: those that create the model, that take data A and produce result B.  
* Machine Learning Researcher: extend state-of the art in ML.

*Note:* the last two roles can be, in some cases, just one and it is called *"Applied ML Scientist"*

* Data Scientist: Examine data and provide insights, make presentation to team and executives.  
* Data Engineer: Organize data, make sure data is  saved in a easily accessible, secure and cost effective way.  
* AI Product Manager: Help decide what to build; what's feasible and valuable.  

##AI transformation Playbook

to create or move towards AI the company might need to restructure itself.

**1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum.**
* More important for the initial project to succeed rather than be the most valuable.  
* Show traction within 6-12 months.  
* Can be in-house or outsourced.  

**2. Build an in-house AI team**

![Build an in-house AI team](/images/build_inhouse_AI_team.png)

It is better have a dedicated unit to work in this projects that a Business unit aside.  

**3. Provide broad AI Training**

Role| What They Should learn|
:---:|:---------------------|
Executives and senior business leaders| 1. What AI can do for your enterprise. 2. AI strategy. 3. Resource allocation. |
Leaders of devisions working on AI projects| 1. Set project direction (technical and business diligence) 2. Resource allocation. 3.Monitor Progress|
AI engineer trainees | 1. Build and ship AI software. 2.Gather data. 3. Execute on specific AI projects |



**4 Develop an AI strategy**

* Leverage AI to create an advantage specific to your industry sector.
* Design strategy aligned with the  "Virtuous Cycle of AI".  

![Virtuous Cycle of AI](/images/Virtuous_Cycle_of_AI.png)  

* Consider Creating a data strategy ( strategic data acquisition, unified data warehouse).  


**5. Develop internal and external communications**

* Investor relations.  
* Government relations.  
* Consumer/user education.  
* Talent/recruitment.  
* Internal Communications.
