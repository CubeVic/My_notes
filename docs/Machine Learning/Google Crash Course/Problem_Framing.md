## Common ML Problem 

In basic terms, ML is the process of training a piece of software, called a model, to make useful predictions using a data set.

There are two common paradigms mentioned in ML, Supervised and Unsupervised training.

### What is Supervised Learning?
Supervised learning is a type of ML where the model is provided with labeled training data, this means that we feed the model with **features** ( $x$ If you want) and the answer or so call **label** ($y$) and it will learn the relationship between these two.


### What is Unsupervised Learning?

In unsupervised learning, the goal is to identify meaningful patterns in the data. To accomplish this, the machine must learn from an unlabeled data set. In other words, the model has no hints how to categorize each piece of data and must infer its own rules for doing so.


## Types of ML Problems

There are several subclass of ML, depending of the prediction task

|type of ML Problem | Description | Example|
|:-----------------:|:-----------:|:-------|
|Classification|Pick one of N labels|Cat, dog, horse, or bear|
|Regression|Predict numerical values|Click-through rate|
|Clustering|Group similar examples|Most relevant documents (unsupervised)|
|Association rule learning|Infer likely association patterns in data|If you buy hamburger buns, you're likely to buy hamburgers (unsupervised)|
|Structured output|Create complex output|   Natural language parse trees, image recognition bounding boxes|
|Ranking|Identify position on a scale or status|Search result ranking|
