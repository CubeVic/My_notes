A C-mount is a type of mount typically use on CCTV cameras. C-mount provide a male thread, which mates with a female thread on the camera.

it’s not possible to easily use a CS-Mount lens on C-Mount, because the **back focal length** won’t match. Therefore, if you find you cannot manage to focus a CS-Mount lens, check if you leave the 5mm C-CS adapter on the thread.

## M12 (S-mount) Lens
