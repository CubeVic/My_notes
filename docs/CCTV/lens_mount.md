# Different types of mount for lens

## C/CS-Mount Lenses

A C-mount is a type of mount typically used on CCTV cameras. C-mount provides a male thread, which mates with a female thread on the camera. 

The common threats are:
* 25.4 mm in diameter.
* 32 threads per pitch (0.794 mm).

The Flange Focal:
* Distance 17.526 millimeters for C-Mount.
* Distance 12.526 millimeters for CS-Mount.

It is not an easy way to use a CS-Mount lens on C-Mount. The main reason is the **back focal length**. They wonâ€™t match. If you cannot focus a CS-Mount lens, check if you leave the 5mm C-CS adapter on the thread.

## M12 (S-mount) Lens

Another typical lens use in CCTV is the M12 or S-Mount lens.

M12 because the lens threat is 12mm, and S stands for Small or short. This lens is shorter or compact comparing with the C/CS-Mount lens because of the size these types of lens are popular on CCTV cameras.
