# Windows error 0x800f0908

When downloading or changing the system language we might see an error `0x800f0908`

This is due to an error or limitation in the internet connection, it often happens if the network used is a metered network.

A way to solve it is by unchecked the option for **metered connection** on the network configuration options.
