I'm Victor. I have been working as an engineer in Asia for the last seven years.  I work in three different fields, Entertainment with a multinational, E-commerce in a startup, and finally, as a Field Application Engineer in a CCTV and AI system manufacturer.

I worked with an in-office team as well as international distributed and remote teams on roles that include:

* Field Application Engineer.
* Product development manager.
* Automation test developer.
* Project manager in Web and mobile development.

I constantly study new technologies and innovative concepts to their rapid and efficient implementation. I developed with experience the ability to perform effectively in teams and as an individual.
