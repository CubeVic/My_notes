[What is raspberry pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUjwk2-qx4)

The most simple of terms, Raspberry pi in all their forms is a mini computer running a modify version of linux debian call raspbian OS, although Raspberry pi foundation has created a special distribution with for these devices, it is possible to install different distribution and some customize images of raspbian OS (linux distro special for Raspberry pi). I most mentioned that now raspberry foundation is offering a microcontroller call raspberry pico, this microcontroller is closer to an arduino that to a single board computer.

## Raspberry models

### Model B/B+
