# Notes regarding APIs

Here I will compile and save the notes about different APIs that we use in a project or that for some reason I need it to understand. 
I will try to create examples and notes about how to use the API.

Here a list of APIs already made notes about: 

* **NewsAPI:** Get news from more than 800,000 sources.
* **Datamuse:** From the official website "series of resources designed to help people create and communicate more effectively."
* **GOOGLE Sheets:** It is the API to interact with Google sheets.
