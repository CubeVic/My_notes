## *Things I learn from error*

#### Cache 
>If CSS is not reflected try clean the cache of the browser.

I was struggling in a project, i made changes on the CSS and didn't see those reflected in the browser, i check the code and the redo the whole thing, add the end and after lot lot of stack-overflow i found one comment on a youtube video recommending clean the cache of the browser, and that solve the issue

## Index

I have several notes in this case, the first notes are from a youtube video and explain how to make a small application that use SQLite as database and Heroku for "live deployment", be aware that the app still use the `DEBUG=True` in a really live app that should be set to `False`.

## How I use it/ How I find it

I wanted to get some UI for some projects, but Django was way to complicated, since the idea was a simple display, just a table and a form, so Someone recommended Flask, and i found that the tutorials were shorter and the documentation was easier to digest than Django. I'm sure Django will have its usage and in some case be a better choice than Django but i think for smaller projects i will stay with Flask.
