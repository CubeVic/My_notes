## How I use it/ How I find it

I wanted to get some UI for some projects, but Django was way to complicated, since the idea was a simple display, just a table and a form, so Someone recommended Flask, and i found that the tutorials were shorter and the documentation was easier to digest than Django. I'm sure Django will have its usage and in some case be a better choice than Django but i think for smaller projects i will stay with Flask.

## Things i learn from error

#### Cache
>If CSS is not reflected try clean the cache of the browser
I was struggling in a project, i made changes on the CSS and didn't see those reflected in the browser, i check the code and the redo the whole thing, add the end and after lot lot of stack-overflow i found one comment on a youtube video recommending clean the cache of the browser, and that solve the issue


```python 

```
